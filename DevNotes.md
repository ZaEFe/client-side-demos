# Next Steps:
- Make School Projects Webpage at [SchoolProjects](src\demos-projects\school_proj\index.html)
    - Make it like the [FreeCodeCamp](src\demos-projects\freecodecamp\index.html) with boxcontainers that show a sample of the project but have a button to go to the full version.

- Add FreeCodeCamp projects to 
        [FreeCodeCamp](src\demos-projects\freecodecamp\index.html) webpage
- **Update navbar** with the dropdowns mentioned in the notes on the [HomePage](src\index.html) 

- Add more school projects:
    1. SQL
    2. Python
